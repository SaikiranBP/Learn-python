# Learn Python
This repository contains the code and documentation on my learning journey. The idea is to craete directroy for each chapter as and when I learn Python. This README file will be updated as and when I create a new directory/chapter. 

## Learning resources 
To get started we will learn python using the book Automate The Boring Stuff with Python.
